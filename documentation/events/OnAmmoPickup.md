# OnAmmoPickup (player_ammo_pickup)

This blueprint is triggered when the player picks up ammo. Currently does not seem to work.

## Available rules

- [Event Data](GlobalEventData.md)
- [Player Data](GlobalPlayerData.md): with prefix: *player*
- `item (string)`: the type of ammo that was picked up (TODO: link to ammo list)
