# OnExitBuyzone (exit_buyzone)

This blueprint is triggered when a player exits a buy zone.

> [!CAUTION]
> Depending on the workshop map (default maps should be no problem) this event will trigger very often. This could slow down the server with many players online!

## Available rules

- [Event Data](GlobalEventData.md)
- [Player Data](GlobalPlayerData.md): with prefix: *player*
- `canbuy (bool)`: if the player is allowed to buy
